# Query for Sound - searching for the unnameable

This is my masters thesis in for my major in  "sound for picture" at the Filmuniversity Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF.



After a long time of thinking about how to improve a sound designers daily tasks, I found a fruitful field of innovation potential for nowadays audio post production workflows. By opening my writing process to the public, I want to share my private research results and inspire other audio and programming enthusisasts to start building thier own prototypes.



I decided to keep the specific film background short, as the task of searching for audio clips is universal for all audio facets - even musicians use soundscapes and samples all the time.



The main topics will include:

- state of the art methods and software in post production
- short overview of common metadata
- audio content search
- statistical methods
- visualization of the results
- concepts to improve workflows in post production
- implementation of a few features as proof of concept 



Stay tuned and feel free to write me a message about what you think about the topic or if you have something valuable to share with me.

Best regards,
